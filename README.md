# Circular-Objects-Motion-Prediction

Currently there are many security cameras/live stream cameras. And due to connection network issues, frame loss might occure. That's why predicting the motion of the objects on the screen is crucial for these security cameras.

This code is able to track multiple randomly-moving balls/circular objects' motion using Uncented Kalman Filter using the tutorial https://machinelearningspace.com/object-tracking-2-d-object-tracking-using-kalman-filter-in-python/.
